\subsection{Alpha Predictor Design}
The Alpha Predictor uses global prediction, and local prediction. The global prediction is indexed by a global path history into an array of saturating counters. The local prediction is indexed by PC into a local history table; the result of the local history table is then used to index into an array of saturating counters.
