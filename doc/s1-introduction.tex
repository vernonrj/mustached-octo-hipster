\section{Introduction}
This project simulates the Branch Predictor from the Alpha 21264, and implements a branch target predictor for fun and profit.

\subsection{Branch Target Prediction}
The Alpha 21264 predicted branch outcomes using a global predictor, and a local predictor. A tournament predictor would then choose which predictor to use based on path history.

\subsection{Branch Target Buffer}
