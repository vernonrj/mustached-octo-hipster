\section{Introduction}
This project simulates the Branch Predictor from the Alpha 21264 and implements a branch target predictor of our design.

\subsection{Branch Target Prediction}
The Alpha 21264 predicted branch outcomes using a global predictor, and a local predictor. A tournament predictor would then choose which predictor to use based on path history.

\subsection{Branch Target Buffer}
The Branch Target Buffer uses that uses a PC-relative and a PC-absolute cache. Targets that are close to the current instruction are placed into the PC-relative cache. A circular return stack is used for returns. All caches are exclusive.
